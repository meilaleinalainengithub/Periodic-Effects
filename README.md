# Periodic Mob Spawner
## Highly customizable Minecraft Datapack focusing on Granting a Random Effect every X seconds.

This project is my third go on a Minecraft Datapack, therefore not very good, nor efficient. This Datapack uses PRNG (with help from u/mingshi3_uiuc) to randomize the mob spawn. To see a list of all effects go to [effect.mcfunction](https://github.com/meilaleinalainengithub/Periodic-Effects/blob/main/data/pe/function/effect.mcfunction) The Datapack features the following commands:

* /function pe:spawn_timer {Timer:x} - x=ticks before next mob spawn

This datapack has been tested and works in following versions:

* 1.21.4

## How to install this datapack
It's very simple! Just follow these instructions:
1. Download the PeriodicEffects.zip from releases.
2. Unzip the zipped folder.
3. Go to ".minecraft\saves\yourworld\datapacks" and drag the datapack in there. 
3. Alternatively, you can create a new world in-game, go to "More", click on "Data Packs" and drag the datapack in there.

The Datapack will begin as soon as you join the world, to disable/enable the datapack run:

* /datapack disable "file/Periodic Effects"
* /datapack enable "file/Periodic Effects"

## Found a bug?
You can do the one of the following:

* Submit an issue detailing what occured, how it occured and or if you modified the datapack in any way. 
* DM me on discord (username: meilaleinalainen).
* Try to fix it yourself. This datapack is poorly made so I wouldn't recommend this option.
